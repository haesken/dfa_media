Archives of dfhack & tilesets for use with [Dwarf Fortress Auto](https://github.com/haesken/dwarf_fortress_auto)

## Structure

### Tilesets

Tileset archives should contain the `data` and `raw`
directories at the top level. There should also be
a `init.txt` file configured for the tileset in the
`data/init` directory.
